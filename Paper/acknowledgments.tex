I would like to thank the following professors for writing me letter of recommendations and for their own respective contributions:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Dr. Jed Rembold for dealing with all my stupid questions regarding life and this thesis.

	\item Dr. Rick Watkins for being pretty dang funny.

	\item Dr. Daniel Borrero for forcing me in class to \textit{explain} code instead of just turning it in.

\end{itemize}
I would also like to thank the following people for being pretty swell and whatnot.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Adam Newton Wright for his future contributions on our Nobel Prize-winning discoveries, as one can never have too many gold-plated coasters.

	\item Kelsey Walker for having optimism so bright it would immediately oversaturate our all-sky camera's sensors.

	\item Mark Watney for making all my problems seem lame.

	\item All the angels on Stack Overflow who spend their time answering weirdly specific coding questions that I end up looking at years later.
\end{itemize}
